## What is a URL?
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location and how to retrieve it.

## What is HTTP?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

## How to read a URL?
A URL is typically read from left to right, where the scheme (e.g., https://), domain name (e.g., example.com), port number (if specified), path, query string, and fragment are identified.

## The scheme for an HTTP URL
The scheme for an HTTP URL is typically "http://" or "https://", indicating the protocol used for communication.

## What is a domain name?
A domain name is a unique name that identifies a website on the internet.

## What is a sub-domain?
A sub-domain is a division or subset of a domain, used to organize and navigate within a website.

## How to define a port number in a URL?
A port number can be defined in a URL using the format "http://example.com:8080", where 8080 is the port number.

## What is a query string?
A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be passed to the web server as parameters.

## What is an HTTP request?
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to request a resource from a server.

## What is an HTTP response?
An HTTP response is a message sent by a server to fulfill a client's request, containing the requested resource or an error message.

## What are HTTP headers?
HTTP headers are additional information sent with an HTTP request or response, providing metadata about the message and the communication.

## What is the HTTP message body?
The HTTP message body contains the actual data being sent in an HTTP request or response, such as form data, JSON, or HTML content.

## What is an HTTP request method?
An HTTP request method specifies the action to be performed on a resource, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

## What is an HTTP response status code?
An HTTP response status code indicates the success or failure of an HTTP request, with codes like 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), etc.

## What is an HTTP Cookie?
An HTTP Cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the web browser, used for tracking and maintaining session information.
