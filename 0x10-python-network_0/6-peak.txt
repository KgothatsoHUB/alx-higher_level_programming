The complexity of the algorithm used in the find_peak function is O(log(n)). 
This is because the algorithm employs a binary search approach to find the 
peak in the list of unsorted integers, which reduces the search space by 
half in each iteration, resulting in logarithmic time complexity relative 
to the size of the input list.
